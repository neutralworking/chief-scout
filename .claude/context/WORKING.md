# Working Context — Chief Scout
> Last updated: 2026-03-30 (session 32)

## Current Sprint: Launch Prep
Target: **May 1, 2026** (from CEO assessment PR #113)
OTP Deadline: **April 7, 2026** — WC 2026 playoffs buzz

### Launch Gates
1. **PL data completeness** — all 20 PL clubs with full squads, grades, scouting notes
2. **Prod DB fix** — PROD_POSTGRES_DSN broken ("Tenant or user not found")
3. **Stripe E2E** — keys missing, billing flow untested
4. ~~**OTP 48 nations**~~ — DONE: 48/48 playable, squads precomputed, women filtered
5. ~~**OTP conversion hook**~~ — DONE: UpgradeCTA on reveal, verified session 32
6. **Stale branch cleanup** — only 1 unmerged remote remains

### Done (from previous sprint)
1. ~~**Data Density**~~ — 28,633 people in staging
2. ~~**Four-Pillar QA**~~ — precomputed daily via cron
3. ~~**41-Role Taxonomy**~~ — migration 049, pipeline 83+27, 41 system-validated roles
4. ~~**Fixture Predictions**~~ — PRs #107-108, migration 044, pipeline 69
5. ~~**Systems & Roles**~~ — 28 systems, 308 slots, AF calibration, GK weight fix

### Session 35 (2026-03-31)
- **SportMonks API assessed**: free tier = 4 leagues, no advanced stats, not worth integrating
- **EAFC PlayStyle pipeline**: 4 new scripts (56b/c/d/e) extracting non-statistical attributes
- **56b**: 11,024 PlayStyle traits imported (Finesse Shot, Rapid, Tiki Taka, etc.) for 5,692 players
- **56c**: 5,489 inferred traits from grade thresholds for 2,535 players (12 rules, position-gated)
- **56d**: 6,532 preferred_foot backfills (44%→59% coverage) + 2,870 Two Footed/Skill Moves traits
- **38c re-run**: 5,352 sides inferred from new foot data
- **56e re-run**: 47,155 playstyle-derived attribute grades bridged
- **27 re-run**: 13,132 ratings + 50,082 compound scores recomputed with enriched data
- All traits in `player_trait_scores` only — NOT surfaced in UI, used as pipeline input signals

### Session 32 (2026-03-30)
- **Migration 050 applied**: dropped old role tables
- **OTP audit**: 5 design questions validated, 5 UX fixes (dedup, balance, retry, formation preserve, back-nav)
- **11 domestic leagues** added to AF pipeline (Egypt, SA, DR Congo, Iran, Iraq, Indonesia, Peru, Costa Rica, Panama, Honduras, Qatar)
- **Fuzzy name matching** (Strategy 4): last-name-exact + first-name JW + nationality boost, 21 new matches
- **SA PSL**: 531 stat rows, 63 player matches
- **Daily cron**: `af_refresh.sh` at 6am+6pm UTC via macOS crontab (AF Pro expires 2026-04-18)
- **Full pipeline runs**: 113k AF grades, 11,412 ratings, 17,681 archetypes, 48/48 OTP squads
- All migrations through 050 on staging. (045 on prod)

### Session 30 (2026-03-29/30)
- **Systems & Roles LIVE**: philosophy→system→slot→role hierarchy. 41 roles, 28 systems.
- **Calibration**: AF ×1.5 cap 15, garbage override, GK weights fixed, DM/WF weights fixed
- **Poacher → Prima Punta** (Striker+Target) — not a system role
- **Archetypes**: Distributor→Conductor (961), Colossus→Titan (318) — role name collisions
- **Position fixes**: Dembélé→CF, Bellingham→AM, Ronaldo→CF. Enzo dupe merged.
- **68 scout grades** across 9 data-limited top players
