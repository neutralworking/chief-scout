# Chief Scout — Outstanding Tasks

## High Priority

### Data Density (Strategic Priority #1)
- [ ] **Run `22_fbref_grades.py`** — 0 fbref-sourced grades in attribute_grades table. Zero-effort data density win.
- [x] **Apply migration 029** (`pipeline/sql/029_trait_scores.sql`) — player_trait_scores table + availability columns
- [x] **Run personality rules** — `python 34_personality_rules.py` (15 players updated)
- [x] **Run personality LLM** — `python 35_personality_llm.py --min-level 85 --limit 50`
- [ ] **Manual personality review** — `/admin/personality` for top 50 players (LLM pass done, needs human QA)
- [ ] **Scale to 200+ full profiles** — target by end of March (currently ~50). Requires automated generation from external data.

### External Data Replacement (FBRef scraper dead)
FBRef manual ingest (script 11) now works via CSV import (`pipeline/fbref_paste_to_csv.py`). EPL, La Liga, Bundesliga 2025-26 CSVs added. Multi-source strategy to exceed coverage:

| Source | Pipeline Script | What it replaces | Status |
|--------|----------------|------------------|--------|
| **FBRef CSV** | `pipeline/11_fbref_ingest.py` | Season stats via pasted CSVs | DONE (PR #84, #86) |
| **Kaggle datasets** | `pipeline/45-50_kaggle_*.py` | Euro leagues, transfers, FIFA historical, PL stats, injuries | BUILT (PR #85, migration 033) |
| **API-Football** | `pipeline/XX_api_football_ingest.py` | Season stats: passes, tackles, dribbles, shots, cards, ratings | TODO — build |
| **Fotmob** | `pipeline/XX_fotmob_ingest.py` | xG, defensive actions, passing, match ratings | TODO — build |
| **StatsBomb** (existing) | `pipeline/08_statsbomb_ingest.py` | Event-level data (select comps only) | DONE |
| **Understat** (existing) | `pipeline/09_understat_ingest.py` | xG/xA per match (top 5 leagues) | DONE |

- [ ] **Build API-Football ingest** — register key, build pipeline script, map to `attribute_grades`
- [ ] **Build Fotmob ingest** — unofficial API, build pipeline script, map to `attribute_grades`
- [ ] **Update script 22** — generalize grade computation to accept multi-source season stats (not just FBRef)
- [ ] **Update `player_id_links`** — add `source='api_football'` and `source='fotmob'` matching
- [ ] **Update `SOURCE_PRIORITY`** in frontend API routes — add new sources to priority chain

### Data Freshness (Strategic Priority #2)
- [ ] **News cron** — automated refresh every 2-4h (#53). Sprint item #1. Last automation gap.
- [ ] **Materialized view auto-refresh** — trigger after pipeline scripts

### Product & UX
- [ ] **Production deployment to Vercel** — create prod Supabase project, set env vars, first promotion (#32). Blocked until profile count higher.
- [ ] **Create prod Supabase project** — prerequisite for production launch. Needs to happen this week.
- [ ] **XP system v2** — move to real XP scale (Ballon d'Or=1000, World Cup=500, debut=10) with separate integration into valuation engine. Current small-modifier system is interim.
- [ ] CS Value formula still produces inflated values (Foden 174m, Rodri 153m) — needs age curve and league weighting review

- [ ] Revisit CSPER personality names: Blade (INSC) and Warrior (AXLC) are placeholders
- [ ] Pipeline script renumbering — scripts 31-37 have duplicate numbers (3× 31, 2× 32, 2× 34, 3× 36, 2× 37)

## Fixture Previews — Remaining
- [x] ~~Run migration `030_fixtures.sql`~~ — applied 2026-03-16
- [x] ~~Add API key to `.env.local` + Vercel~~ — done 2026-03-16
- [x] ~~Ingest fixtures (all 5 leagues, 415 matches)~~ — done 2026-03-16
- [ ] **Fixture-based club verification**: Build `38_fixture_club_verify.py` once fixture data populated
- [ ] **Add Vercel env var to preview** — git repo not connected, only production set

## Radar Fingerprints — Expansion
- [ ] Add MiniRadar to shortlist detail page (`/shortlists/[slug]`)
- [ ] Add MiniRadar to club detail page key players section (`/clubs/[id]`)
- [ ] Add MiniRadar to TrendingPlayers component (homepage)
- [ ] Extract fingerprint computation to shared `lib/fingerprint.ts`
- [ ] Player comparison page (`/compare`) — overlay 2-3 fingerprint polygons

## Go-to-Market (from CEO review)
- [ ] **Production Supabase** — spin up separate project + run `40_promote_to_prod.py`
- [ ] **Analytics** — no tracking at all currently, need Mixpanel/Plausible/PostHog
- [ ] **Landing page** — visitors hit dashboard, not a marketing pitch
- [ ] **SEO** — per-player OG images, structured data, sitemap
- [ ] **Onboarding** — no help docs or tour for new users

## Medium Priority

### Data Quality
- [ ] **Dedup improvements** — upgrade player matching from exact name to fuzzy (Levenshtein/Jaro-Winkler) with confidence scores. Flag ambiguous for manual review (plan A2)
- [ ] **Data quality dashboard** — per-field completeness heatmap + stale data flags in `/admin`. API route exists (`/api/admin/data-quality`), needs UI (plan A3)
- [ ] **StatsBomb event extraction** — extract progressive carries, pressure events, shot-creating actions from existing `sb_events` data (plan B2)
- [ ] Club stadium capacities — Wikidata P115 qualifier spotty, needs targeted enrichment
- [ ] ~2,600 clubs without wikidata_ids — build bulk SPARQL name matcher
- [ ] Build `pipeline/32_trait_inference.py` — infer traits from FBRef stats for four-pillar
- [ ] Build `pipeline/33_physical_metrics.py` — aggregate FBRef minutes into availability scores
- [ ] Editor pillar tabs — reorganize into Technical/Tactical/Mental/Physical sections
- [ ] Add materialized view auto-refresh after pipeline scripts
- [ ] Women's players: decide long-term approach
- [ ] 3 manual profiles not found (Tchouameni, Cubarsi, Dembele) — accent mismatches

### Pipeline
- [ ] **Parallel pipeline execution** — asyncio/multiprocessing for independent scripts (news, stats, wikidata). 3-5x speedup (plan F7)

### Product & Features
- [ ] **Comparison tool** — side-by-side player radar + stats (ROADMAP Phase 2)
- [ ] **Formations seed** — populate from research data (#54, sprint item #2)
- [ ] **Product polish** — glass consistency, archetype styling (#55, sprint item #3)
- [ ] **Free agent grader** — ranked shortlists (#26)
- [ ] **Scouting radar** — statistical alert system (#25)
- [ ] **News-driven alerts** on player list (#23)

### Data Enrichment
- [ ] Apply migration 024 (network_roles + network_edits tables)

## Low Priority
- [ ] Player list pillar spark bars (needs precomputed scores or batch API)
- [ ] Valuation model integration with four-pillar scores (Phase 5)
- [ ] Clean up more duplicate players (accent variants)
- [ ] Network page (`/players`) — user building smarter sorting/highlighting (rising players, XP buffs, score deltas)
- [ ] Vercel deployment not picking up changes — check Hobby plan settings
- [ ] **LLM-powered name matching** — build `pipeline/lib/llm_match.py` for transliteration/nickname/accent resolution (plan G4)
